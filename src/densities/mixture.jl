"""
    MixtureDistribution(components, weights)

A custom mixture distribution implementation, parameterized by:
* `C` type family of the mixture
* `CT` the type for the weights

This implementation solves:
* [Distributions.jl Issue 1669](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl/issues/1669)
* [ReactiveMP.jl Issue 253](https://github.com/biaslab/ReactiveMP.jl/issues/253)
